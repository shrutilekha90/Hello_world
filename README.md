# Hello_world
Git  is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files, originally designed for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development.Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

What is Git and why it is used?
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
